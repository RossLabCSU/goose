What is GOOSE?
===============
***GOOSE : Generate disOrdered prOtiens Specifying propErties*** is a python package developed to make the generation of IDRs or IDR variants easy. Basically, we want to make it easy for you to design IDRs or IDR variants for your research.

***A quick note -***
While we have done extensive testing on GOOSE functionality, due to the massive sequence space that is possible when generating an IDR, you may encounter bugs. We would appreciate if you would report these bugs. Furthermore, **it is best practice to double check that the sequence generated by GOOSE is the sequence you intended to make**. You can do this using the ***analyze*** module included with GOOSE. 

We are also very excited to hear from you about any feature requests! Please email me at remenecker@wustl.edu with the subject line **GOOSE feature request** and I'll be happy to see if I can make it happen. My goal is to make this *as useful as possible to the protein disorder community*.

Why was GOOSE made?
--------------------
It is difficult to know which properties of any given intrinsically disordered protein region (IDR) are important for function. Is it the hydropathy? Maybe the fraction of charged residues? Who knows! Further, generating IDR variants can be a tricky task. This is why we made GOOSE. GOOSE lets you **1.** generate *synthetic* IDRs to study how different sequence properties or fractions of amino acids impact some aspect of disordered proteins and **2.** create IDR variants based on an IDR that you are interested in so you can figure out which aspects of your IDR of interest are important for function. 

How can I use GOOSE?
--------------------
You can use GOOSE from Python or from a Google Colab notebook. The Colab notebook can be found at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U9B-TfoNEZbbjhPUG5lrMPS0JL0nDB3o?usp=sharing

Installation - GOOSE takes flight!
===================================
Right now you can only install GOOSE through Github. It will be on PyPi to allow for pip installation soon!

To install directly from the git repository simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/idptools/goose.git

Or to clone the GitHub repository and install locally run - 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/idptools/goose.git
    $ cd goose
    $ pip install .

**Important note**

GOOSE also requires the package ``sparrow``. Sparrow should be downloaded automatically just by pip installing GOOSE, but if you have issues, try installing it by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/holehouse-lab/sparrow.git

This will install SPARROW. **Important note**: if your attempted install of SPARROW fails, it may be because you do not have numpy or cython installed. I made them both required for installation of GOOSE, so if you install GOOSE first, you should be ok. If you still have problems, try running from terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install cython
    $ pip install numpy



What all can GOOSE do?
=======================
There are four main functionalities currently in GOOSE. 

**1.** Generatae IDRs where you can specify the properties *length*, *average hydropathy*, *fraction of charged residues (FCR)*, *net charge per residue (NCPR)*, and *kappa*, which is a property that defines opposite charge distribution in a sequence.

**2.** Generate IDR variants. The different variants I currently have implemented should allow you to address many questions you might be interested in by letting you choose which parts or properties of your IDR to hold constant and which to change. This can really narrow down on *what makes your IDR of interest work*. More on the variants later though.

**3.** Make sequence libraries. This includes libraries of sequences spanning different sequence properties or fractions of amino acids. 

**4.** Sequence analysis. Analysis includes sequence properties, fractions of amino acids, and various predicted sequence features. Predicted sequence features are all machine learning based and were generated using PARROT (see https://github.com/idptools/parrot). Predictions include phosphorylation sites, cellular localization, and transcriptional activation domains.
