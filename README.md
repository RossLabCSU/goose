# GOOSE : Generate disOrdered prOtiens Specifying propErties

## What is GOOSE?
GOOSE is a python package developed to make the generation of IDRs or IDR variants easy. Basically, we want to make it easy for you to design IDRs or IDR variants for your research.

### A quick note - 
While we have done extensive testing on GOOSE functionality, due to the massive sequence space that is possible when generating an IDR, you may encounter bugs. We would appreciate if you would report these bugs. Furthermore, **it is best practice to double check that the sequence generated by GOOSE is the sequence you intended to make**. You can do this using the ***analyze*** module included with GOOSE. 

We are also very excited to hear from you about any feature requests! Please email me at remenecker@wustl.edu with the subject line **GOOSE feature request** and I'll be happy to see if I can make it happen. My goal is to make this *as useful as possible to the protein disorder community*.

## Why was GOOSE made?

It is difficult to know which properties of any given intrinsically disordered protein region (IDR) are important for function. Is it the hydropathy? Maybe the fraction of charged residues? Who knows! Further, generating IDR variants can be a tricky task. This is why we made GOOSE. GOOSE lets you **1.** generate *synthetic* IDRs to study how different sequence properties or fractions of amino acids impact some aspect of disordered proteins and **2.** create IDR variants based on an IDR that you are interested in so you can figure out which aspects of your IDR of interest are important for function. 

## What all can GOOSE do?

There are four main functionalities currently in GOOSE. 

**1.** Generatae IDRs where you can specify the properties *length*, *average hydropathy*, *fraction of charged residues (FCR)*, *net charge per residue (NCPR)*, and *kappa*, which is a property that defines opposite charge distribution in a sequence.

**2.** Generate IDR variants. The different variants I currently have implemented should allow you to address many questions you might be interested in by letting you choose which parts or properties of your IDR to hold constant and which to change. This can really narrow down on *what makes your IDR of interest work*. More on the variants later though.

**3.** Make sequence libraries. This includes libraries of sequences spanning different sequence properties or fractions of amino acids. 

**4.** Sequence analysis. Analysis includes sequence properties, fractions of amino acids, and various predicted sequence features. Predicted sequence features are all machine learning based and were generated using PARROT (see https://github.com/idptools/parrot). Predictions include phosphorylation sites, cellular localization, and transcriptional activation domains. 

## How can I use GOOSE?

You can use GOOSE from Python or from a Google Colab notebook. The Colab notebook can be found at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U9B-TfoNEZbbjhPUG5lrMPS0JL0nDB3o?usp=sharing

## Installation - GOOSE takes flight!

Right now you can only install GOOSE through Github. It will be on PyPi to allow for pip installation soon!

To install directly from the git repository simply run:

	$ pip install git+https://github.com/idptools/goose.git

Or to clone the GitHub repository and install locally run - 

	$ git clone https://github.com/idptools/goose.git
	$ cd goose
	$ pip install .

**Important note**

GOOSE also requires the package ``sparrow``. Sparrow should be downloaded automatically just by pip installing GOOSE, but if you have issues, try installing it by running:

	$ pip install git+https://github.com/holehouse-lab/sparrow.git

This will install SPARROW. **Important note**: if your attempted install of SPARROW fails, it may be because you do not have numpy or cython installed. I made them both required for installation of GOOSE, so if you install GOOSE first, you should be ok. If you still have problems, try running from terminal:

	$ pip install cython
	$ pip install numpy

## Sequence Generation

GOOSE allows you to easily generate sequences. GOOSE verifies disorder ofthe generated sequence using metapredict V2 before returning it to you. The default cutoff for disorder is 0.5. However, you can alter this if you'd like.

### Important limitations to be aware of

**A quick note on discrepencies between input properties and the actual values of generated sequences**. GOOSE by default allows a small amount of error for hydropathy (it is allowed to be off by 0.07, which is honestly negligible) and for kappa (it is allowed to be off by 0.03). This is basically a balance between accuracy and speed. If you install GOOSE locally, you can go into goose/backend/properties and modify these values globally . Finally, if you choose an NCPR / FCR combination that is mathematically impossible, GOOSE will get as close as it can.


### Speed of sequence generation

The protein disorder field moves fast, and we are not here to slow your research down. It was important for us to make GOOSE as fast as possible. However, because GOOSE incorporates stochasticity into sequence generation (see below for more on that), GOOSE still has to do some work when designing your disordered sequence. Importantly *the more properties you specify, or the more constraints you put on sequence design, the more time it will take GOOSE to generate your sequence*. 

 
### Stochasticity of sequences generated using GOOSE

Making a an IDR generator is not inherently difficult. However, making an IDR generator that can make many different sequences with the same overall properties is a bit harder. We designed GOOSE to have a bit of stochasticity in that it will *generally* not make the same sequence twice. However, we want to emphasize that *the more properties you specify when making sequences, the less available sequence space there is for GOOSE to explore. This will increase the chance that GOOSE will make the same sequence twice*. This is generally not a problem, but it is something that we want users to be aware of.

*An important exception to this rule is the ``create.minimal_var()`` function because it attempts to change as little of the input sequence as possible and therefore will frequently return the same sequenece multiple times.*


### Failed sequence generaton

Sometimes GOOSE can't make your sequence. However, you can usually just run the code a few times and GOOSE will eventually land on a solution that matches your specified properties (thanks to the inherent stochasticity in sequence generation). The reason we designed GOOSE this way is to avoid situations where you try to make a sequence that is difficult for GOOSE to generate and GOOSE spends 10+ minutes working it out. If you still can't get a sequence you want, try *slightly* adjusting your properties or reducing the disorder cutoff value.


### Incompatible FCR, NCPR, and hydropathy values

GOOSE uses a rescaled Kyte Doolittle hydropathy scale for calculating mean hydropathy. This scale goes from 0 to 9 where higher values are more hydrophobic. The charged residues have low hydropathy values (R = 0, K = 0.6, D = 1, E = 1). Therefore, if you have a sequence with too many charged residues, you limit how high the mean hydropathy can possibly go. If you specify a high FCR and a high hydropathy, that sequence may be mathematically impossible to make. GOOSE will return an error if you do this. 


### Limits on mean hydropathy**

The more hydrophobic a sequence, the less likely it is to be predicted to be disordered *generally speaking*. The higher the mean hydropathy value, the harder time GOSE will have in making the sequence.


# Using GOOSE from within Python

To use GOOSE from within Python, first import *create from goose*

    from goose import create

Once *create* has been imported, you can start making seqeunces and sequence variants!

## Generating sequences with specified sequence properties

The ``create.sequence()`` function lets you create sequences predicted to be disordered with various specified properties. 

The only required argument is the length, which must be between 10 and 10,000. In addition, you can also specify several parameters.

1. `hydropathy`: Average hydropathy, which must be between 0.1 and 6.1.

2. `FCR`: The fraction of charged residues, which must be between 0 and 1

3. `NCPR`: The net charge per residue (`NCPR`), which must be between -1 and +1

4. `kappa`: The kappa value is a charge asymmetry parameter where higher values mean greater charge asymmetry. This must be between 0 and 1.

**Importantly, you do not need to specify all of these sequence properties simultaneously.** For example, if you specify FCR and hydropathy, GOOSE will return sequences that have varying NCPR values while making sure that the specified hydropathy and FCR values are what you input. In this way, you can generate many sequences that have the fixed properties that you want to stay fixed, while other properties can vary.

In addition to the above parameters, you can specify:

1. `cutoff`:  The disorder cutoff used defines a threshold GOOSE uses to selected/reject sequences. A higher cutoff means higher confidence that the sequence is disordered. The default value is 0.5. If you have difficulty making your sequence, you might want to try lowering the cutoff value.

2. `attempts`: The number of attempts defines how many times GOOSE will try to generate a desired sequence. This is relevant because certain parameter combinations of values are more challenging than others, and GOOSE implements a stochastic design algorithm such that different sequences are generated every time. For harder sequence compositions you may need to increase this from the default value. 

#### Examples

Just specifying length:

    create.sequence(40)
    'GDHNKAGQPPRKCSDQGGAGAPNPDCDPDTAPMDGDRMTN'


Specifying length and hydropathy:

    create.sequence(100, hydropathy = 3)
    'MTSYGRDGSPETGEGSTGTNSSSSRSMMGSTHNWQQYNGGTTSGTSSTGDSHRTHGDHSAGETTSGGDSEGTDETSTTTNGRGSSSGHDGSTGQDTNTRR'

Hydropathy values can be between 0.0 and 6.1. **Note**: the higher the hydropathy *over 5*, the longer it will take GOOSE to generate the sequence. Sequences that are very hydrophobic and disordered can be tricky to make. **Note**: whenever specifying hydropathy values, GOOSE will return a sequence within 0.07 of the specified value! This amount of error helps keep GOOSE fast (and a difference of 0.07 is typically negligible).

**Specifying length and fraction of charged residues (FCR):**

    create.sequence(40, FCR = 0.3)
    'GDRPSEHGQGPRKEDGMDQDDVSTEGHEWSNNPCNQSNNP'

FCR values can be between 0 and 1

**Specifying length and the net charge per residue (NCPR):**

    create.sequence(40, NCPR = -0.2)
    'MQKNDRAPDHKDREKDGPIKERPEECPDDEQSDDEECPSH'

NCPR values can be between -1 and 1.

 
**Specifying multiple properties**

GOOSE lets you combine different properties simultaneously. Importantly, any value you do not specify will just be random.


**Examples**

**FCR & NCPR**

    create.sequence(100, FCR = 0.3, NCPR = -0.1)
    'TSNQDKEMPQQHSPRCQPGEKVSDPPRSSDNSTNGGARPQQDWRPPEHMNPNRYEPNTMHQNREGRESAGGKDWPNPTIDQNQDPHEDTDNQEEESDHPC'

You cannot have values for NCPR where the absolute value of NCPR is greater than the specified FCR value. 

**Important note on combining FCR and NCPR!** Whenever NCPR and FCR are combined, if the combinations of the length, NCPR, and FCR are not mathematically possible, GOOSE will get as close as it can. In addition, GOOSE  prioritizes NCPR over FCR, and the resulting sequence may deviate in terms of FCR as a result.

**FCR & Hydropathy**

    create.sequence(100, FCR = 0.3, hydropathy = 3.2)
    'KVDSGTTSCSGERESDSGDLKSSKEGSSGSGSSSKSSKSKEATGSSTDTTAAAGGKGGGGGGDGGKGDGRGKGGGGGGEGRDGGGGGGEGGRGGGGRKRD'

**Note** - The higher FCR (or NCPR because the absolute value of NCPR must be at least equal to FCR) specified, the lower the maximum possible hydropathy because charged residues have a *very* low hydropathy value.

**NCPR & Hydropathy**

    create.sequence(100, NCPR = -0.3, hydropathy = 2.4)
    'REARGDAKGERDRGGDAKDKGAESGKDDDGEEEGAGEEEGEEGDDEAEADRADKERAERDKGDRDRAEGRAEKGAAAAEGADEGADEADEEEDDDADDEE


**NCPR, FCR, & Hydropathy**

    create.sequence(100, hydropathy = 2.65, NCPR = -0.3, FCR = 0.4)
    'NETPARPETHRDTASTSEGDETSEPEGTWSSNEADTDDDAETEHSPMSEDGERCESSKDAPPMRDEEGDDEDVEDTPDVSSSPDYEPGGHYSESNNDWPD'


**NCPR, FCR, Hydropathy, and kappa**

    create.sequence(100, hydropathy = 2.65, NCPR = 0.0, FCR = 0.4, kappa=0.2)
    'GKDETATKRQKAPPVDRREAPAKHKRTTAGRRDRSPKEKETRMGQGGPEGESPSSGGDETEGIMARKASEDSTPGKMNSSRDRSDGEHGETPPVEPDPNH'


### Generating sequences by specifying fractions of amino acids in Python

The ``create.seq_fractions()`` function lets you create sequences predicted to be disordered with specified fractions of various amino acids. With this function, you can specify multiple amino acids simultaneously. Each fraction should be specified using a decimal value (for example, if you want one-tenth of the amino acids to be alanine use `A=0.1`).

For each amino acid, we had GOOSE attempt (at least 10,000 times for each value) to make sequences with increasing fractions of each amino acid until we identified the maximum possible fraction. The default maximum values for each amino acid are as follows - 

	"A" - 0 : 0.95, 
	"R" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"N" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"D" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"C" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"Q" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"E" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"G" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"H" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"I" - 0 : 0.53, 
	"L" - 0 : 0.42, 
	"K" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"M" - 0 : 0.62, 
	"F" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"P" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"S" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"T" - 0 : 1.0, 
	"W" - 0 : 0.55, 
	"Y" - 0 : 0.99, 
	"V" - 0 : 0.71

Note that if you pass in requested fractions those fractions must be equal to or less than 1.

In addition to specifying the specific amino acid fractions, other parameters can be passed to the `create.seq_fractions()` function:

1. `cutoff`:  The disorder cutoff used defines a threshold GOOSE uses to selected/reject sequences. 

2. `attempts`: The number of attempts defines how many times GOOSE will try to generate a desired sequence. 

3. `max_aa_fractions`: If you wish to generate sequences with extreme compositions it may be necessary to over-ride the default max fractional values. This can be achieved by passing a max_aa_fractions dictionary, which should specify key-value pairs for amino acid-max fraction information. 


#### Examples

**Just specifying a single amino acid fraction:**

    create.seq_fractions(100, Q=0.3)
    'QEQNGVDQQETTPRQDYPGNQQPNQQAEGQQMQSTKMHDQHDSVNEDQEQNQNPWGHQPHMKGESNSSAREAQSEDQQNQAQNQQQNHDSTQQQDGQMDQ'

**Specifying multiple amino acids:**

    create.seq_fractions(100, Q=0.3, S=0.3, E=0.1)
    'QEQQSQKASQSQVESQDSSESSAPGSSQMHQQQSQSQEGMEQHQSSVGNSSSYPQSEQSEQQRQQSSQDQQQQSSSQTSEENSQSRQHDMSDTEMSGSQR'

**Note** - 
Some combinations of amino acids are simply not possible to make that are predicted to be disordered using the default settings. Specifically, specifying high fractions of multiple aliphatics or aromatics may not be predicted to be disordered using the default cutoff value.

**Specifying none of a specific amino acids:**
If you want to exclude an amino acid, you can set it equal to 0.

    create.seq_fractions(50, A=0)
    'NKERPTGSWDEPPFDEGSSGMTNEDMGNKPYPTTDMQPEKWPQNDQQGST'
    

**Overriding default max fractions:**  

	create.seq_fractions(100, Y=0.5, max_aa_fractions={'Y':1}) 
	'SSYYYYYSYSSYYSYSSGHYYSYSSYYYSSSYYSSYGGTYGYYSYSYGYYSSYYYSYSSNYYYYYYYYSSYGNSGYGGYYSYYSSSQHHYSSYYYSYYSY'
 

## Creating Sequence Variants in Python

Apart from simply generating sequences, GOOSE can help you make different types of sequence variants. In contrast to when you generate a sequence, the primary input into the sequence variant functions are your sequence of interest. 

### Disorder cutoffs when creating sequence variants

When making sequence variants, by default GOOSE will use the predicted disorder values of your input sequence as the threshold disorder values for the returned sequence. However, you can change this by setting *strict_disorder* to *True*.

#### Types of sequence variants

``constant_class_var()`` - Variant with the same properties as the input variant as well as the same order and number of amino acids by class. GOOSE will try to change the sequence as much as possible within these constraints.

``new_seq_constant_class_var()`` - Variant where the sequence composition is new but the numbers of each residue from each class and the overall properties are the same.

``constant_properties_var()`` - Variant where **only the sequence properties** are constrained. There are no constraints on classes of amino acids. 

``constant_residue_var()`` - Variant where specific residues are held constant. The variant will have the same aggregate properties as the original sequence.

``shuffle_var()`` - Variant that will shuffle specific regions of an IDR. Multiple regions can be specified simultaneously.

``excluded_shuffle_var()`` - Variant where you can specifically shuffle a sequence *except for any specified residues.*

``targeted_shuffle_var()`` - Variant where you specify *which residues are shuffled*. Any residues not specified will not be shuffled. 

``asymmetry_var()`` - Variant where a class of residues (see below for classes) or a user-specified list of residues is changed to become more asymmetrically or less asymmetrically distributed throughout the sequence. Does NOT change sequence composition.

``hydro_class_var()`` - Like the ``constant_class_var()``, properties and the order / number of amino acids by class is held constant. However, hydropathy can be increased or decreased within this constraint. *Note* - because classes of residues are constraints, there are limits to how much you can increase or decrease the hydropathy of any specific sequence.

``fcr_class_var()`` - Function to make a sequence variant that adjusts the FCR while minimizing changes to the position and number of amino acids by class.

``ncpr_class_var()`` - Function to make a sequence variant that adjusts the NCPR while minimizing changes to the position and number of amino acids by class.

``kappa_var()`` - Variant where you can alter the charge asymmetry by changing the kappa value. Requires the presence of positively charged and negatively charged residues in the original sequence. Higher kappa values increase charge asymmetry, lower kappa values reduce charge asymmetry. Values can be between 0 and 1. 

``all_props_class_var()`` - Function to make a sequence variant that adjusts the FCR, NCPR, hydropathy, and kappa values while minimizing changes to the position and number of amino acids by class. If you don't specify one of the values, GOOSE will keep it the same as it was in the input sequence.

**A note about FCR, NCPR, and all_props_class_var variants**
For the ``fcr_class_var()``, ``ncpr_class_var()``, and ``all_props_class_var()`` variants, the changes to amino acid by class is **MINIMIZED** but not necessarily kept exactly the same. This is because if you (for example) change FCR in your sequence, it is IMPOSSIBLE to keep the order and number of all amino acids by class the same in the returned variant. Similarly, with the NCPR variant, if you change the NCPR to the extent that the FCR has to change as well, then it will change the order / number of amino acids by class.


For all class variants, apart from user-specified lists of residues, classes can also be specified. The classes are categorized as followed:

aromatic : 'F', 'W', 'Y' 
polar : 'Q', 'N', 'S', 'T' 
positive : 'K', 'R' 
negative : 'D', 'E' 
hydrophobic' : 'I', 'V', 'L', 'A', 'M'
Special Cases : 'C', 'P', 'G', and 'H'
The 'Special Cases' residues are, for any function that accounts for the class of a residue, not interchangable with any other residues. 

### The constant_class_var()

The ``constant_class_var()`` generates a variant with the same properties as the input variant as well as the same order and number of amino acids by class.

**Example**

    test = 'QEQNGVDQQETTPRQDYPGNQQPNQQAEGQQMQ'
    create.constant_class_var(test)
    NDNQGAENNDQNPRNEYPGQSSPNQNADGNNAS


### The new_seq_constant_class_var()

The ``new_seq_constant_class_var()`` makes a sequence where the sequence composition is new but the numbers of each residue from each class and the overall properties are the same.

**Example**

    test = 'QEQNGVDQQETTPRQDYPGNQQPNQQAEGQQMQ'
    create.new_seq_constant_class_var(test)
    QNSAQNDGQNENYQPQGDNPDKNGTSQEAPQAN


### The constant_properties_var()

The ``constant_properties_var()`` makes a sequence where **only the sequence properties** are constrained.

**Example**

    test = 'QEQNGVDQQETTPRQDYPGNQQPNQQAEGQQMQ'
    create.constant_properties_var(test)
    MEHPTHDQYDQNHKQEPTGSNPNGTPHETNPQP


### The constant_residue_var()

``constant_residue_var()`` - Variant where specific residues are held constant. The variant will have the same aggregate properties as the original sequence. You can specify more than one residue to be held constant at once.

**Example**

    test = 'QEQNGVDQQETTPRQDYPGNQQPNQQAEGQQMQ'
    create.constant_residue_var(test, constant=['T', 'Q'])
    QEQSANDQQETTPKQEAPSPQQASQQHEGQQPQ


### The shuffle_var()

``shuffle_var()`` - Variant that will shuffle specific regions of an IDR. Multiple regions can be specified simultaneously.
**Note** - The shuffle_var does **NOT** use index values like you would normally in Python. For the shuffle_var, 1 = the first amino acid in the sequence **NOT 0**. 

**Example with one shuffled region**

    test = 'QQQEEENNNDDDQQQEEENNNDDD'
    create.shuffle_var(test, shuffle=[3,9])
    QQNQENNEEDDDQQQEEENNNDDD

**Example with two residues constant**

    test = 'QQQEEENNNDDDQQQEEENNNDDD'
    create.shuffle_var(test, shuffle=[[3,9], [15, 23]])
    QQNNEEQNEDDDQQNDENNEDEQD

**Notice that when you specify 2 regions, you use a list of lists (a nested list).**

### The excluded_shuffle_var()

``excluded_shuffle_var()`` - Variant where you can specifically shuffle a sequence *except for any specified residues.*

**Example**

    test = 'QQQEEENNNDDDQQQEEENNNDDD'
    create.excluded_shuffle_var(test, exclude_aas=['N', 'D'])
    QEQEEQNNNDDDQQEQEENNNDDD

### The targeted_shuffle_var()

``targeted_shuffle_var()`` - Variant where you specify *which residues are shuffled*. Any residues not specified will not be shuffled. 

**Example**

    test = 'QQQEEENNNDDDQQQEEENNNDDD'
    create.targeted_shuffle_var(test, target_aas=['N', 'D'])
    QQQEEENNDNNNQQQEEEDDNDDD




### The asymmetry_var()

``asymmetry_var()`` - Variant where a class of residues or a user-specified list of residues is changed to become more asymmetrically or less asymmetrically distributed throughout the sequence. Does NOT change sequence composition.

**Example** - 

**Changing polar residues, no specification of changes property** - 

    test = 'NSQSSQDSQDKSQGSQNQQEQSDSSEQTKQEEDGQTSSDSREQSQSHSQQ'
    create.asymmetry_var(test, 'decrease', 'polar')
    NSQSSQDSQDKSQGSQNQEQSDSSEQTQKQEEDGQTSSDSREQSQSHSQQ
    
**Example** - 

**Changing polar residues, increased number of changes** - 

    test='NSQSSQDSQDKSQGSQNQQEQSDSSEQTKQEEDGQTSSDSREQSQSHSQQ'
    create.asymmetry_var(test, 'increase', 'polar', number_changes=30)
    SNSQQQSSNTQSSSQSSQSSSTQQSSQQQQSQQQDDKGEDEKEEDGDREH
    

**Changing polar residues, decrease asymmetry** - 

    test='SNSQQQSSNTQSSSQSSQSSSTQQSSQQQQSQQQDDKGEDEKEEDGDREH'
    create.asymmetry_var(test, 'decrease', 'aliphatic', number_changes=30)
    QNQSTSQQSDDQQKSTNGSSEDSQQESQKQESSEQSSDQGSQDSSQREQH
    

**Changing custom list, increase asymmetry** - 

    test='RGNNLAGIVLGAAGAMNGRTEGRKGEQTHGKSGNDDRGHTGDRSHGNKNRGE'
    create.asymmetry_var(test, 'increase', ['G'], number_changes=20)
    RNNLAIVLGGGGGGGGGGGGGAAAMNRTERKEQTHKSNDDRHTDRSHNKNRE
    


### The hydro_class_var()

``hydro_class_var()`` - Like the ``constant_class_var()``, properties and the order / number of amino acids by class is held constant. However, hydropathy can be increased or decreased within this constraint. *Note* - because classes of residues are constraints, there are limits to how much you can increase or decrease the hydropathy of any specific sequence. If you go past the maximum change, GOOSE will raise an error where the error message specifies the minimum and maximum possible values for your sequence (see below).

**Example decreasing hydropathy** - 
The starting hydropathy of the sequence below is  2.0272. Let's raise it to around 2.7.

    test = 'GNGGNRAENRTERKGEQTHKSNHNDGARHTDRRRSHDKNAASRE'
    create.hydro_class_var(test, hydropathy=2.7)
    GTGGTKIETKTEKKGETTHKTTHTDGLKHTDKKKTHDKSAASRE

**Example where hydropathy is raised higher than possible**

    test = 'GNGGNRAENRTERKGEQTHKSNHNDGARHTDRRRSHDKNAASRE'
    create.hydro_class_var(test, hydropathy=3.7)
    goose.goose_exceptions.GooseInputError:
    Unable to get to objective hydropathy without changing classes of residues.
	For this sequence the lowest possible hydrpathy is 1.611364.
	For this sequence the highest possible hydropathy is 2.834091.


### The fcr_class_var()

``fcr_class_var()`` - Function to make a sequence variant that adjusts the FCR while minimizing changes to the position and number of amino acids by class.

**Example** - 
The starting FCR of the sequence is 0.0. Let's increase to 0.2.

    test = 'TTGGATSQAGGATHAQSHANSGTQSTSSPQTQGVNTTSANGQHGQATNQS'
    create.fcr_class_var(test, FCR=0.2)
    TTGGATSQAGGATHAESHARSGTDSTSSPKTQGVETTSAKGDHGKATEKS


### The ncpr_class_var()

``ncpr_class_var()`` - Function to make a sequence variant that adjusts the NCPR while minimizing changes to the position and number of amino acids by class.

**Example** - 
The starting NCPR of the sequence is 0.909. Let's lower it to 0.0.

    test = 'GNGGNRAENRTERKGEQTHKSNHNDGARHTDRRRSHDKNAASRE'
    create.ncpr_class_var(test, NCPR=0)
    GNEGERGENRAENRTDGKQDTKHESRNDHRNEGRAHRTSHNAAS


### The kappa_var()

``kappa_var()`` - Variant where you can alter the charge asymmetry by changing the kappa value. Requires the presence of positively charged and negatively charged residues in the original sequence. Higher kappa values increase charge asymmetry, lower kappa values reduce charge asymmetry. Values can be between 0 and 1. 

**Example** - 

First we can take something with very symmetrically positions oppositely charged amino acids and increase the kappa value. For reference, the starting kappa value for this 'test' sequence was 0.0012.

    test = 'QNEKRDQNEKRDQNEKRDQNEKRDQNEKRDQN'
    create.kappa_var(test, kappa=0.9)
    KKRRKKRRRKQNQNQNQNEEEDQDENEDQDDN

Now we can take this newly generated and make the charges more moderately symmetrical (something between what we started with and what we made in the previous example).

    previous_variant = 'KKRRKKRRRKQNQNQNQNEEEDQDENEDQDDN'
    create.kappa_var(previous_variant, kappa=0.15)
    QEEEDRDKEKERDRDRDKNQNQNQNQNKKRQN

**note** GOOSE will allow deviation from your input kappa value by up to 0.02. This is to keep GOOSE from being extremely slow. If you need something closer to your desired value, you can try generating a few variants. You'll likely quickly get the exact value you want within a few tries.


### The all_props_class_var()

The ``all_props_class_var()`` makes a variant sequence that adjusts the FCR, NCPR, kappa, and mean hydropathy while minimizing changes to the order/number of amino acids *by class*. There is only a limited extent to which the NCPR or NCPR can be altered due to the fact that some FCR/hydropathy values are not compatible.

**Example changing all properties** - 
In this example we will change all 4 possible properties.

    test = 'GNGGNRAENRTERKGEQTHKSNHNDGARHTDRRRSHDKNAASRE'
    create.all_props_class_var(test, hydropathy=2.5, FCR=0.23, NCPR=0, kappa=0.1)
    GSGGTKIESRTEKSGQQTHDSNHNNGAEHTNNKDSHQNNAASQK


**Example changing 2 properties** - 
In this example we will just change kappa and hydropathy.

    test = 'GNGGNRAENRTERKGEQTHKSNHNDGARHTDRRRSHDKNAASRE'
    create.all_props_class_var(test, kappa=0.3, hydropathy=2.6)

## About sequence analysis in GOOSE

GOOSE provides powerful sequence analysis tools. These tools are provided by SPARROW - see https://github.com/idptools/sparrow/tree/main. The phosphosite, cellular localization, and transcriptional activation domain predictions are **all machine learning based**. They should be treated **as predictions** and NOT ground truth. 

To start using the analysis tools in GOOSE, first import **analyze**

    from goose import analyze

and then you have a full suite of sequence anlysis tools. The analyze module includes tools for calculating and predicting the following characterstics of your protein of interest (which doesn't even need to be an IDR made in GOOSE!). 

1. Sequence length
2. Fraction of charged residues (FCR)
3. Net charge per residue (NCPR)
4. Average hydropathy
5. kappa - A measurement of charge asymmetry where the max value (1) is the greatest possible charge asymmetry for a given sequence and the min value (0) is the most symmetrical positions possible for oppositely charged residues.
6. Predicted phosphosites for S, T, and Y phosphorylation sites
7. Predicted cellular localization signals including those for nuclear localization, nuclear export and mitochondrial targeting.
8. Predicted transcriptional activation domains
9. The fractions of all amino acids in the sequence.


## Using the analyze module in GOOSE

### Analyzing general properties

To analyze general properties in GOOSE, you can use the 'properties' function.
This function returns a dict containing all basic properties calculated including length, FCR, NCPR, hydropathy, kappa, and fractions of amino acids.

**Example**

	test = 'GNGGNRAENRTERKGEQTHKSNHNDGARHTDRRRSHDKNAASRE'
	analyze.properties(test)
	{'length': 44, 'FCR': 0.4090909090909091, 'NCPR': 0.09090909090909091, 'hydropathy': 2.027272727272727, 'kappa': 0.050873519852757454, 'fractions': {'A': 0.09091, 'C': 0.0, 'D': 0.06818, 'E': 0.09091, 'F': 0.0, 'G': 0.11364, 'H': 0.09091, 'I': 0.0, 'K': 0.06818, 'L': 0.0, 'M': 0.0, 'N': 0.13636, 'P': 0.0, 'Q': 0.02273, 'R': 0.18182, 'S': 0.06818, 'T': 0.06818, 'V': 0.0, 'W': 0.0, 'Y': 0.0}}


### Predicting phosphosites

GOOSE has 3 separate networks each trained on a different phosphorylation sites (S, T, and Y phosphosites). The phosphosites() function in analyze gives you information on all of them at once. 

**Example**

	test = 'GNGGNRAENRTSSKSERKGEQTHKSNHNDGARHTDRRRSHYDKNAASRE'
	analyze.phosphosites(test)
	{'S': [11, 12, 14], 'T': [21, 33], 'Y': [40]}

**It is extremely important to note that this predictor is not a gaurentee of a phosphorylation event!**. Protein phospohrylation is incredibly complex, this predictor should be used more as a way to check on something that you want to avoid being phosphorylated (although as with any 'predictor', nothing can be gaurenteed 100%).


### Predicting subcellular localization

If you design an IDR and it ends up somewhere you don't want it to, that's a bad day in the lab. To try to mitigate this problem, we are working on machine learning-based predictors of cellular localization sequences to try to determine where a given protein might end up. As stated in the phosphosite section, this is not a perfect solution, but it is nonetheless better than nothing. 

**Example**

For a known mitochondrial protein...

	test = 'MAAAAASLRGVVLGPRGAGLPGARARGLLCSARPGQLPLRTPQAVALSSKSGLSRGRKVMLSALGMLAAGGAGLAMALHS'
	analyze.cellular_localization(test)
	{'mitochondria': {'MAAAAASLRGVVLGPRGAGLPGARARGLLCSARPGQLPLRTPQAVALSSKSGLSRGRKVMLSAL': [1, 65]}, 'NES': 'No NES sequences predicted.', 'NLS': 'No NLS targeting sequences predicted.'}

In the returned dict, the key 'mitochondria' brings up the sequence predicted to be the targeting sequence as well as the coordinates of that sequence (where 1 is the first amino acid). For the other two keys, 'NES' for nuclear export sequences and 'NLS' for nuclear localization sequences, because none were detected the value for each of those key value pairs just states that none were predicted.


### Predicting transcriptional activation domains

If you design an IDR, you might not to want it to inadvertantly have a transcriptional activation domain (TAD). To see if your sequence has a predicte TAD...

**Example**

For a subset of a protein with a known TAD...

	test = 'PNNLNEKLRNQLNSDTNSYSNSISNSNSNSTGNLNSSYFNSLNIDSMLDDYVSSDLLLNDDDDDTNLSR'
	analyze.transcriptional_activation(test)
	{'TGNLNSSYFNSLNIDSML': [31, 49]}
	
If there is a TAD present, the function returns the TAD subsequence along with the coordinates for the TAD in the input sequence. 

### Predict everything

If you just want a summary of... well basically everything we've covered so far from properties to all predicted features, that's pretty easy to do! 

**Example**

	test = 'PNNLNEKLRNQLNSDTNSYSNSISNSNSNSTGNLNSSYFNSLNIDSMLDDYVSSDLLLNDDDDDTNLSR'
	analyze.everything(test)
	{'length': 69, 'FCR': 0.2028985507246377, 'NCPR': -0.11594202898550726, 'hydropathy': 3.4130434782608696, 'kappa': 0.4222274422645569, 'fractions': {'A': 0.0, 'C': 0.0, 'D': 0.14493, 'E': 0.01449, 'F': 0.01449, 'G': 0.01449, 'H': 0.0, 'I': 0.02899, 'K': 0.01449, 'L': 0.14493, 'M': 0.01449, 'N': 0.23188, 'P': 0.01449, 'Q': 0.01449, 'R': 0.02899, 'S': 0.21739, 'T': 0.04348, 'V': 0.01449, 'W': 0.0, 'Y': 0.04348}, 'predicted phosphosites': {'S': [67], 'T': [30, 64], 'Y': [18, 37, 50]}, 'predicted cellular localization': {'mitochondria': 'No mitochondrial targeting sequences predicted.', 'NES': 'No NES sequences predicted.', 'NLS': 'No NLS targeting sequences predicted.'}, 'predicted transcriptional activation': {'TGNLNSSYFNSLNIDSML': [31, 49]}, 'sequence': 'PNNLNEKLRNQLNSDTNSYSNSISNSNSNSTGNLNSSYFNSLNIDSMLDDYVSSDLLLNDDDDDTNLSR'}

The analyze.everything() function will return a dictionary holding all of the information from sequence properties to predicted phosphosites, cellular localization, and transcriptional activation domains all from one simple function!

### Predict differences between sequences

If you generate a sequence variant and want to see if you've broken or introduced any sequence features including TADs, cellular localization signalgs, and phosphosites, you can use the ``analyze.prediction_diffs()`` function. The function takes in two sequences as the input and then returns the predicted differences between those sequences. 

**Example**

    test1 = 'PNNLNEKLRNQLNSDTNSYSNSISNSNSNSTGNLNSSYFNSLNIDSMLDDYVSSDLLLNDDDDDTNLSR'
    test2 = 'PTTITEKIKTTITTDTTTFTTTITTTTTTSTGNLNSSYFNSLNIDSMLDDYVSSDLLLNDDDDDTNLSR'
    analyze.prediction_diffs(test1, test2)
    {'S phosphorylation': 'No differences.', 'T phosphorylation': 'sequence 1: [30, 64], sequence 2: [64]', 'Y phosphorylation': 'sequence 1: [18, 37, 50], sequence 2: [37, 50]', 'NLS': 'No differences.', 'NES': 'No differences.', 'mitochondrial': 'No differences.', 'predicted transcriptional activation': ['Sequence 1 predicted TAD - TGNLNSSYFNSLNIDSML : [31, 49] not in sequence 2', 'Sequence 2 predicted TAD - GNLNSSYF : [32, 40] not in sequence 1']}


## Generating sequence libraries in GOOSE

### Generating sequnce libraries by properties

To generate sequence libraries by specifying properties, use the ``create.seq_property_library()`` function. An important things to note ***GOOSE automatically gets rid of sequences not possible to make***. For example, a sequence with an NCPR value where the absolute value of the NCPR value is greater than the FCR will not be included because it's not possible to generate. In addition, GOOSE will check the hydropathy value and see if it is possible based on the FCR. If it's not possible, GOOSE will not make it. However **for incompatible hydropathy / charge values**, GOOSE will print out the sequences it was not able to generate and print them unless you set ``silent_failed_seqs`` to True. In this function, you can specify the length, FCR, NCPR, hydropathy, kappa, and disorder cutoff values. **Note** GOOSE will do it's best to get the kappa value spot on, but it does allow for some error. It will also also adjust the FCR to match the NCPR if the two values are not compatible. This function will return a dictionary of sequences where each sequence is named after the property specified for generating the sequence.

 
For this function, you can specify the property as a single value, a list of two values, or a list with three values where GOOSE will make all possible values from the first number of the list to the second number of the list at an interval equal to the third value of the list.

**Example**

    create.seq_property_library(40, FCR=0.1, NCPR=[0, 0.1], hydropathy=[2, 4, 0.5])

    {'>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0_hydropathy_2.0': 'QKPSQNKNHTPTGQGNSHPQDHPEQQQQQPPQQQSTQNTP', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0_hydropathy_2.5': 'NSNSTSENNKQNNGPHSPGTSQPPNFQPSAPQENSGNGKH', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0_hydropathy_3.0': 'SAPTQDPQSHYTQGGNEQTGGSPTGPPGWSHAKRSPSGQG', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0_hydropathy_3.5': 'NRSSGSCAPLNSAGGTTPGNKEVADPPPPGSTGSWGHQTH', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0_hydropathy_4': 'PSTHSSAGPSDTSASSSARSVPSSDSAVKSSCGSGASTTS', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0.1_hydropathy_2.0': 'QPPSPHQPLSHHSQQHNGNTKKQKSHQPNKNNSHPNNHNQ', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0.1_hydropathy_2.5': 'SGHSQGQNTHTKQGRQRGHGHVSPNQQHSSTPQHMQSPKT', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0.1_hydropathy_3.0': 'TSPSNHPQKPGPTPAGMQTGGTPGKTKHPHHPGSKLQQYT', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0.1_hydropathy_3.5': 'SAMLNASAGNPSGGQQRNSANLGPSRTTQKTSAQARSPTG', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0.1_hydropathy_4': 'PAPKPGAKVVSTSALQRVAKSSPPACSPGTHPGSSPTTSS'}

In the example above, the first value in the function is the length. This value must be a single integer value and is **required**. The second value, ``FCR`` is specified as a single value, so all sequences generated will have that value. The third value ``NCPR`` is specified as a list, so GOOSE made a set of sequences where NCPR was equal to the first value in the list and then a set where NCPR was equal to the second value in the list. Finally, ``hydropathy`` was set equal to a list with 3 values. This means GOOSE was told to generate sequences with a range of the first value of the list ``2``, to the second value in the list, ``4``, at an interval equal to the third value of the list ``0.5``. This resulted in the creation of sequences with values 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0.
**If the third value, which is the interval value, cannot be equally used between the range of sequences, GOOSE will just use the maximum value as the last value.** For example, hydropathy = [2, 4, 1.1] would result in hydropathy values of 2, 3.1, and 4.
In addition, you can add a random name to the end of each sequence name by setting ``random_name=True``. This way, if you combine multiple libraries (if you want replicates of sequences with the varying properties you specify), you don't need to worry about overwriting anything due to a shared name. 

**Example**

    create.seq_property_library(40, FCR=0.1, NCPR=[0, 0.1], hydropathy=[2, 4, 0.5], random_name=True)

    {'>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0_hydropathy_2.0_F0K7D2N5N6': 'TPNHTQPHKNHDNNNPSHNHTGNNPTNPQEHKGSQTNQPT', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0_hydropathy_2.5_G5R2A2L8F8': 'THQNPEDTHTTHPSMSRSNNPQLQNNGQRPAPPSSPHGHN', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0_hydropathy_3.0_E8V4W5C2N2': 'GPGSEHPHAPGDSSTGNNTSGPTKPSTGGALSQNRQPQYP', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0_hydropathy_3.5_C2C3D1F5P4': 'PPTQQPNGQSMSGGARHTTAAAAEGSARMAELSQNHSNGG', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0_hydropathy_4_I3S8I0G9W4': 'APTKGVAPETRSTSPAASSGAGGGGSSPASSMSPSSGDGS', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0.1_hydropathy_2.0_N8E1Y2R5D0': 'PPPSTGHQKQNYSQNHHNNPPQHQRWHRNGPPRPNSHQSG', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0.1_hydropathy_2.5_H3H7I2S0W7': 'NSGGSKRSSSPGPTPNQPQNGRNMPMPQNRQNHTNFQNTP', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0.1_hydropathy_3.0_I2K0M6E2T0': 'TRSHQQPQMHGMPSTSPNGCQTLNSPSSMRKGPPPQSGKN', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0.1_hydropathy_3.5_H3Q4E1L7W8': 'QTSSPQTMGRSQTTTGSASMQSSGMASTSRPPRFSSRSTG', '>FCR_0.1_NCPR_0.1_hydropathy_4_A4D7R8W6V7': 'RTSPTSVKPPTSACKTAAGSTPMTRSPSSSTLAVNGPPAP'}

### Generating sequnce libraries by fractions

To generate sequence libraries by specifying fractions, use the ``create.seq_fractions_library()`` function. An important thing to note ***GOOSE automatically gets rid of sequences not possible to make***. This includes where the fraction of amino acids is greater than 1 (for obvious reasons) and if the fraction of any amino acid specified is greater than the max_aa_fractions limit. The max_aa_fractions limit can be manually overridden (see below). 

For this function, you can specify the amino as a single value, a list of two values, or a list with three values where GOOSE will make all possible values from the first number of the list to the second number of the list at an interval equal to the third value of the list. If only two values are given, GOOSE just uses those two values and does not assume any interval.

**Example**

    create.seq_fractions_library(100, A=0.1, D=[0.1, 0.2], K=[0.1, 0.2, 0.05])

    {'>A_0.1_D_0.1_K_0.1': 'SKSSSGTKEHSEAEDNGEDGAATNHDHNDEHGRATGADDKKNHGHTKEHGAQHQSSQGNNNHDKSNSTRDAHNGARSDKRARNKEKQHQKGQAGENDHGE', '>A_0.1_D_0.1_K_0.15': 'EAAGGHQHGKRQSGKSQSADENKGRKKDESTNKDNTSRQSRETASQGKAKKNNGGPKKAGNQDDAQDESEGSQRSSQQAKDAKNGDDQTKTDEGHSTKAQ', '>A_0.1_D_0.1_K_0.2': 'TGGAGKDASAGDATKDRAKSDNKGKTKKERAAKTQNKSHNQAQEKRTGESSHKEKRKDGENQAKSHSKNHKQRKPADTQKTEDERHEEHGHEDKKDEDEQ', '>A_0.1_D_0.2_K_0.1': 'DSSNATTSNDQDDKSHDSNTQAHDQREVGNSKDSNSNASDDENKAGQENTSAEEDNPDDHEEKDDNDRDGHAKKKTSADKDGDNDREAKASHNGKNAEEG', '>A_0.1_D_0.2_K_0.15': 'DQGDEKAQTDASKSKNDTGAADKHGKAKQTGKEEENQDDGKTDDHSGPTDGQDNRGDKKSEGTDDKAKDQQDDTDEQATTTTKRAGHAADEDSTNRKKRS', '>A_0.1_D_0.2_K_0.2': 'SDDKDRRDKQAHSNKHADAKSNEASHRKKHAGKHGQDTGKKDDGQNKDSADKTHKTKDGDSEQKAHDTSEADQAKKDGDHNGEDGDEDGDKAGKKQGNKN'}

In the example above, the first value in the function is the length. This value must be a single integer value and is **required**. The second value, ``A`` is specified as a single value, so all sequences generated will have that value. The third value ``D`` is specified as a two item list, so GOOSE made a set of sequences where the fraction of ``D`` is either 0.1 or 0.2. Finally, ``K`` was set equal to a list with 3 values. This means GOOSE was told to generate sequences with a range of the first value of the list ``0.1``, to the second value in the list, ``0.2``, at an interval equal to the third value of the list ``0.05``. This resulted in the creation of sequences with values 0.1, 0.15, 0.2.
**If the third value, which is the interval value, cannot be equally used between the range of values from the lowest to the highest, GOOSE will just use start at the lowest value and increase until it can't any more and then will add the maximum value.** For example, K = [0.1, 0.2, 0.08] would result in K fraction values of , 0.1, 0.18, and 0.2.
In addition, you can add a random name to the end of each sequence name by setting ``random_name=True``. 

***Additional usage***

Some other things you can specify are:

``warn_user`` - used to determine whether to warn the user of any problems with generating the sequnces. By default is set to True, but you can set it to False. 
``robust_warnings`` - used to return a warning message FOR EVERY SEQUENCE THAT HAS A FRACTION VALUE NOT EQUAL TO THE INPUT VALUE. This can be annoying for large library generation and is by default set to False. Set to True to get more information on the sequences that have errors and what those errors are. 
``max_aa_fractions`` - used to override the max amino acid fractions. Input as a dict. Example below:

**Example**

    create.seq_fractions_library(100, A=0.1, D=[0.1, 0.2], K=[0.1, 0.2, 0.05], max_aa_fractions= {'K': 0.16})

    {'>A_0.1_D_0.1_K_0.1': 'TQHHDEKNRRAEANDSPNGDEHAQDGKHSAEKQRTQHAENSDRDHSEGAKGNNQHGRKKQENERRAGGGKQTHKNTSQDHGDRNAKDDAQNGQQHHNKHA', '>A_0.1_D_0.1_K_0.15': 'QRKGNSANSGERADHTGDHDTQNAATTGKRKDNKEKKNDKHSARAQNTDKKAHTEKGSKHATQNAHNESQPGGDETNSKKHASTGQGKGNNDSRKGRDDN', '>A_0.1_D_0.2_K_0.1': 'AQQRQDQGGDAKDADDRTDARKDTETSPAKQEQAGRSDDKGPDDTDQKAESPTESNERDQQGQETGDDKQQKKGSEDAHSQDQDGKGPDQGKDAHQAGSR', '>A_0.1_D_0.2_K_0.15': 'EGPQATSTDDEDDHHKSKDESADEGAKSGKRTEENDRAATDTAHHATKDHDDHHKTDGPEKTKDETKKADKEGHHKKDTAEKQEDNANSSTDDTQPSKDD'}

In the above example, we manually overrode the max fraction for K and set it to 0.16. This eliminated sequences where the K fraction was 0.2 like in the example above where the max_aa_Fractions were left as default.


## How to cite GOOSE

You can not currently cite GOOSE as we have yet to publish it (hopefully soon!). We would appreciate if you would mention GOOSE in your methods section with a link to the Github page so readers of your paper can understand how you generated the sequences you used.
